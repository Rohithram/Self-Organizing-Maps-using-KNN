# Follow these steps
 * Download this folder, cd into the folder
 * then do "pip install -e ."
 * This will install the python files as a package in your local machine which will get updated even after you do some changes in the python files.
 * To see the main files go to anomaly detectors folder where all python files are placed.
 * In this specific folder is there for a specific detector, which has all important master python files
 * And all other dependencies are located in utils and reader_writer folder for main master python file
 * All the notebooks are placed in Notebook folder in parent folder along with datasets and setup file,etc.
